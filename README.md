# tic_tac_toe

Tic Tac Toe, also known as "X and O," is a timeless and beloved two-player game. The goal is simple: get three of your marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 game board.

For my Flutter Spin on the Classic Game, I wanted to recreate the traditional Tic Tac Toe experience while adding some delightful elements with Flutter. The game comes with a beautiful and intuitive user interface and smooth gameplay. This app offers a seamless and enjoyable experience for all ages!
